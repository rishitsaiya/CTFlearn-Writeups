This problem is a simple introduction to reversing.

If you have no experience with reversing but know a little of C/C++ 
these two YouTube videos from LiveOverflow will give you a 
basic introduction to Reversing to help solve this challenge.

If you are new to reversing my Reykjavik and Riyadh problems are 
little easier than this one and you probably want to solve those 
challenges first (after watching the above two videos :-) ).

If you go to the work of solving my Reversing Challenge, I'd like for you to
be able to see the sources if you are interested.

I have encrytped the zipped sources using the challenge flag as the
password to decrypt the sources.  Solve the challenge, get the flag,
decrypt the sources.

openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -k flag -out sources.zip -in sources.zip.enc

Please don't share the flag with anyone else or share the sources used to
create the challenge or use this source to create your own challenge.  Please.

I am on Twitter and Discord as @kcbowhunter.  But I can't teach you Assembler or
Reversing, you have to learn that yourself.  There are lots of good videos available
on YouTube, LiveOverflow is an excellent place to start.  Good Luck!
