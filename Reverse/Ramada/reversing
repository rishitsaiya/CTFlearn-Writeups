If you are new to Reversing LiveOverflow on YouTube has some great videos, check out his
Reversing Tutorial:

If you are really new to CTF's and Ethical Hacking but want to learn here is a good place to start:

And here is a free book on Reverse Engineering / Assembler:

Ahd the associated reversing challenges:
https://challenges.re/

------------------------

If you are new to assembler, asmtutor.com is a great place to start.
It is for 32 bit assembler, but the concepts still apply to 64 bit and you will learn a lot
if you are new to assembler.  Note that the system calls are different between 32 and 64
bit assembler.

If you are not sure about hexadecimal notation such as 0xbaadf00d then this is a
great video series for learning the basics.

I mean, if you look at 0xbaadf00d and don't know immediately how many bytes and bits are in that
hex value without thinking about it, this video is a great place to learn the basics:

Some of these Reversing Challenges can be solved using the Ghidra disassembler alone.

If you are serious about Reversing Ghidra should be one of your tools.
Ghidra is an open source project from the NSA and it's free.

Thanks to @Rivit for pointing out angr.io:
http://angr.io/

angr is a tool for analyzing binary (executable) files.  It is very powerful tool and has been used to solve
some of my Reversing challenges and I am sure many others also.

If you do solve one of my Reversing challenges using angr please send me a DM with your angr Python script, I would
enjoy seeing it.

Here is another tool for Reversing:

Ida PRO is the premier disassembler and debugger... but it's commercial and it's expensive:

Thanks to @Rivit for passing this resource along too:

You can see that Reversing is a discipline and domain unto itself.  It is an advanced discipline that requires a good
understanding of Assembly Language.  Be prepared to do a lot of work (see above) if you want to master
Reversing.
