## Help Bity
The main idea is to try to figure out what encryption is used on the flag.

#### Step-1:
I thought it was ROT47. It was not ROT47.

#### Step-2:
I used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)'s Magic option. [Here](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Magic(3,true,false,'CTF')&input=QlVHTWRgc296YzBvYHN4XjByXmB2ZHIxbGR8) is the full flag solve link.

#### Step-3:
Finally flag becomes: `CTFLearn{b1nary_1s_awes0me}`
